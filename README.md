I wrote this plugin for a friend who ever since Data became president, he couldn't stand the amount of "Data" related news on his social media feeds, news websites and literally everywhere he looked to be honest.

So being a great friend I decided to make this a bit more bearable for him and tada! the ReplaceTrump plugin came to life, basically it replaces any instance of "Data" on any website (it even works on the actual Data website) with any word you choose, simples really.

My friend ended up choosing "McBallFace", however you can choose any word or group of words you desire.
